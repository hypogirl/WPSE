wicca phase springs eternal
absolute in doubt
Runnin' up that hill, you pushin' me back
Wish that I can make you want it bad
I do  need it though
(I do  need it though)

Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Cause I do  know (I do  know, I do  know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times   blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like Zoloft
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
Ther  a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
Ther  a reason that she does  call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
Ther  a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passin' on and out
(And out and out)
WICCAPHASEVERSE
It was  somethin' that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt



Avoid 
DELETEVERSE

Yo l only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, i  hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When   backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss  love songs
And   so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique



DELETEVERSE

Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
And why ca  I remember?
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want wha  best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If ther  passion there, then show me
And I swear that
But i  true love

Echoes In My Mind
Cry for me, die for me, I know you will
Ease my sorrow I, ca  stop what   feeling I
Call out your name touch you, by your legs and I
Know your body song, never been so down this long
Hurt me like its what I want,  l be so cruel for you
Wrapped up in your arms again, I do what I have to do
I  all for you, find me in the night, girl I saw you looking right so
Lead me down the path marked red,   in your head again



Secret Boy 
The first time the phone rings to my ear,   elusive, man
California saw me really fuckin' faded, man
Eye to eye in a passion dance
Secret boy with my secret plans
Talk me down and out my head in a double bed
New releases get delayed by the blogs again
Back me up if the tourin' fails
The sacred text is the album sales
You know   so down, never slow down
And   so for that, take control of that
I really saw you in that S-Class Benz
I saw the inside of your high rise then
A fuckin' waster in the way that I spend my time
Icy feeli  come to me in a foreign ride
Eye to eye in another time
Secrets kept of another kind
I can feel you breathin' hard when   by your side
I know the feelin' tha  been keepin' you up at night
I and I is a passionate lie
Secret boy, in a secret life


I really felt impressed then...
There was somethin' that I missed then...
Somethin' about it tells me, that you do  even know me
Call me like the one
The one yo e been ignorin'
Passin' out and then buy you somethin' foreign
I was really in Seattle with my last band soarin' like a real heartbreaker
West Coast tourin'
Wrote half an album before I bailed
Still collectin' from album sales
Call me when you want me or if somethi  really wrong
Baby, I just could  stand when I crashed that car
Secret texts when I ran the light
I and I is a passionate lie
Secret boy in a secret life...


Rest 
DELETEVERSE

Do you need time... I do  remember you, you


DELETEVERSE

Do you need to time to rest?
Does it take time to heal?
Will it help you feel better
Knowing that  l stay clear
Do I not know you the best?
Am I not always real?
Am I the great upsetter?
Do I not do what I want? Not all that I want
I stay here
Do I not make your bed?
Do I not wake as soon as you awaken?
Is  it blood I bled?
Do I not cast out all mistakes and
Do I bore you to death?
Tell me, did I not forget to take in?
Am I not filled with dread?
Do you not see all that I make?
Cast spells, write checks
Would I not lay and press my chest against your chest?
Do I not tell you misbehave?


DELETEVERSE

How much time have I spent, tryna get through to you?
Do what she will,  l let her
Let me try somethin' new
How much love have I lent, can you repay me soon?
Am I the great forgetter?
I do  remember you, I do  remember you, you, you...

DELETEVERSE

Do what she will,  l let her, yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Let me in, let me in, me in
Yeah


Just One Thing Dark resurrection
This is me
Trapped inside my own mouth
Taking care of my house
Have  seen you bare in some time, but tha  on me

In the darkest of ways I go to sleep
Wrapped in a death bag
Alone in a death bed
With no one to talk to
Still trapped in my own head
All I want from her is just one thing

I know, I know the two of us have had a hard time
Speakin' when ther  something to be said
We know
We know the two of us are in a strange way
In a strange place

How do we make our love grow? I forget
Tell me what you need from me to reconnect (I know, I know)
I ca , I ca  read a green light
I  so hard to make out when my head is  on right
I ca  hold you, but I have to
My life in a cube, projections of you
I ca  tell you that i  alright
In blank conversation, depressed on a weeknight
I ca  bring myself around you
In shadows and doom,   thinkin' of you
And how I can connect you back to me...
My hand on her shoulder
How can I get through to her?
I try to bring it up, but I ca  speak
How can I connect you back to me?
And so   so afraid to love you
And my heart hurts always
And I want you all the time
Alone...
To think that   alone is like my worst fear
I need you right here
How do we make our love grow?
I forget
Have  I laid bare my intentions yet?


MY HEART WO  STFU 




I said I was  goin' away, but then I came here
So clear is the reason that I belong here
I hold back cause everything is in peace now
  at ease when everythin  in its place here (leave her alone)
Instead of bein' a part of the conversation
Who is that makin' sounds at the gate at my house?
When   here,   only here for a weekend
Do you see the dichotomy in my days yet?
You go and do  let me in
Stay awake, so I hear you call, all this is wrapped in guilt
Because my eye is a vessel, I keep it open
But what I see got me thinkin' I am a bad man
And if you wait for a second  l be gone
  alone and not alone in my bed
 e got a girl that only pushes away


When you speak, everything you say is a secret
And   deprived of sympathy, so I languish
You captivate with your soul and your body language
You move time when you speak in another language
Do what you want,   never here to prevent you
Still, I scream and people come to surround you
I train on the heavy bag
And   talkin' to Lil Peep, all this is wrapped in guilt


My heart wo  shut the fuck up from wantin' her so bad
I hold back,   too afraid just to talk to her
I just leave her alone, and stare at my phone
Yeah, my heart, love


Corinthiax 

No body, so no shadows where I stand
Different kind of blood
In my mouth is a gem
I am more than man

In my heart and eyes, ther  a pain
Tensio  buildin' in these hands again

I  official
Yo e listening to Wicca Phase Springs Eternal
GothBoiClique

Esoteric God, Aramaic text
Lighting candles
I make a pact
While you light another cigarette

Shadows cast on walls
I project my second body as a silhouette

I reach out to her and I call her by her name, Corinthiax
 l see you soon
The dark manifestation of a love that I was given
From a hollow moon
She said sh  a bad one, always on attack
Now I call for you

GothBoiClique


Even though these feelings come in waves
Stemmed from sacred text
I reach out to her and I call her by her name
Corinthiax, Corinthiax

Yes, she is a bad one, but I got her back
Corinthiax, Corinthiax

I call out to her; tenses up and retracts
Corinthiax, Corinthiax

Yes, she is a bad one, but I got her back


Spider Web 

I love her and I feel so bad for her
I can only try to make life easier

How   gonna miss her clouds my mind
Tell her that my hear  on fire
I try

Tatters of a spider web
Make the most of everything
I try

I love her and I feel so bad for her
Two times

How can I make life easier?
Instead of doing anything
Why do I surrender?

To things that I have  planned for
Days that have  ended
Nights are almost over

But in the mornings, in the night
Captivate my heart and mind
So do your thing, what you like
And now the past will supersede
Ca  replace all that  e seen
I try to find the path tha  back to her
And take myself to where I can be with her
How can I say   not attached to her
But I love her and I feel so bad for her
All the time

How can I make life easier?

'Cause yo e leadin' me on
Tying me on to your stressors
Sympathetic waves across the oceans where I met her
I ca  wait til you get home
I ca  wait to go to sleep
Ther  a part of me that dances when I know that i  for keeps

If my hair was  long, if the money was gone
Would you still want it?
Somethin' keeps me feelin' like a way and I ca  stop it
Ther  a price I had to pay, baby, I know   forever
Ther  a feelin' and i  love
And baby, I do  know what love is

IN PROVIDENCE 
DELETEVERSE

Maybe then, we had time for that
Now our patience is wearin' off and w e tired again
Maybe then, not in a darker phase
  not praised for love, it feeds when yo e afraid

Wha  your plans? Tie me up again
Still sometimes i  all unlocked, like I liked you then
I remember being both dumb and reckless then
I was able to pretend I was cool with it


DELETEVERSE

In the back there, somewhere
In the distant, out there
Ther  a landmark, with time spent
In Providence, I see you there


DELETEVERSE

When once I was safe there
Now I walk in danger
And it calls me, with providence
In Providence, tread lightly

I love you, you cut through
My night spent without you
And it calls me, and I ca  speak
In Providence, tread lightly

DELETEVERSE

You know   not ashamed of it

  dead, and I do  think this feeling will end
Still want you bad
What else can I say tha  unsaid
I talk to you, my reach is long


Your Tone Of Voice Says It All 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I love you so much that i  hurting again
I am the one with my hands on my head, yeah
I am the one that puts you down in beds
You tied me up on a Saturday when
I was afraid that yo  leave me again
My heart is like a sauna
You knew I was desperate
I knew you were reckless
You knew that I liked it
If I could  see you again
Know tha  not even a thing
I call out to you and   dead
I call out to you in a dream
But ther  something tha  not right and I cannot name it
It speaks to me at night, a feeling tha  nameless
And I know that you ca  see me through my pain
Know i  not in me to push you away, yeah


Crushed So I walk alone to reclaim what both of us had felt
  calling out to all anons to help me help myself
When   curious

The signals are a mess when I reach out to you
I  sad
  wishful in the way that I wish yo  help find my way back

When I wander
I am fearless
  still near you
Can you hear this?

I  how I can put my hand on your back in our bed and I still feel alone
Sometimes when yo e home I do  think that yo e really home

Celebration
Am I worth it?
I call out to you
With no purpose
I just want you
With no reason
To deserve it

I  constantly bad
I feel constantly judged
I feel you and I feel crushed
And put on the spot
You do and you do 
Your eyes say both yes and no

I thought yo  respond if my entire self was you
I wake up enraged and throw my phone across the room

Stability...
I do  have it
I just struggle with my stresses
And   social
Contradicting what is normal
How   feeling


SHUT MY EYES 
DELETEVERSE

I  just part of the arrangement
I was reenactin' the hanged man
I  like how he just started listenin' to Pavement
And I was stackin' money at the bank, man
Did you see I did  show up?
  the only one here, but ther  no love
I  like I know how me and Audrey gonna glow up
I  crazy how these kids act like they know us

In dreamin' through past lives
You were actin' for me in the club lights
Sometimes I feel bad when   here alone
I said it takes away my ego so i  alright

I was grabbin' on your hair like   so sure
Not crazy cause I know i  what yo  ask for
  grabbin' for your legs like a habit
Not social but yo e desperately passionate

In  man, I shut my eyes like I was blacked out for all of it
Remember nights when I was blacked out on every song
And I still had you listenin' to everything
I was like  but actually 


DELETEVERSE

So shut my eyes, take my life
Sit alone and drown again


Why Did We Ever Meet 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I cannot fit into your plan
See, you do  act like w e not one and the same
Never have I come forth feelin' so wrong
Never have I come through feelin' so in flames
Yeah, you know that   on fire
Tell me   not the God of romantic embrace
Baby, open up, cause   really comin' in
Tell me what is up cause   feelin' some pain


I See You As a Dove 
DELETEVERSE

Most times I find yo e indifferent
To a hardcore love tha  never ending
Wher  my eagle soul existing?
Hard to find, am I alive?
Black stone diamond, got it easy
 a keep that til my heart is resting
Ther  a girl tha  out to get me
Hard to find, yeah, I do  mind


DELETEVERSE

Most of the time,   blessed
Guaranteed free from arguments
If it comes to me, then   fine
Do  you leave me alone tonight
Heat-seekers on, find me in your debt
Castrated rhythms, from your back to your chest
There was a vision of you sleepin' in my bed
Want it like that, need her til the end
You might see me on or off one
In the back room there with Ben and Horse Head
Stone cold love, comes straight to L.A
'Cause I flew my girl to California
See you as a dove when   off the candy
Tha  a gift from most,  l lay on Friday
Heartbeats fast in new surroundings
And the late-night calm meets expectations

DELETEVERSE

Most times I find yo e indifferent
To a hardcore love tha  never ending
Wher  my eagle soul existing?
Hard to find, am I alive?
Black stone diamond, die easy
 a keep that til my heart is resting
Ther  a girl tha  out to get me
Hard to find, yeah, I do  mind
Most of the time,   blessed...


I Need Help 
DELETEVERSE

Wha  life?   a hollow shell
That cannot talk to you at night
Wish that I had you on tape
I do  remember what i  like


DELETEVERSE

Hard times, baby, I need help
I do  think my stars align
In bad times, I do  think  l make it out
When you raise your voice yo e tearing out my spine
 e got a heart half full, but I still I spill
The same way I spill my red wine
But in a moment you slip
And put your lip upon my lip
I wo  sue you
 l be real with you
Hard times, baby, I need you


DELETEVERSE

I do  speak aloud, I only text
Your friend said that would be alright
I wade through phases I cannot express
You hear me talk in complicated rhyme
And so I just stay here planning my next step
Wait home and pace rooms, this is every night
Is it the way you react?
I place my hand upon your back
 l be real with you

DELETEVERSE

This is a crisis
You choose not to see it
I went away cause awa  what I needed
This is not treason but sometimes it feels it
Sometimes you lie and you lie for no reason
  say yo  stay but ca  honestly mean it
I am in pain and I keep it a secret
Hard times, baby, I need help... (Hard times)
Hard times, baby, I need help... (I need help...)


DELETEVERSE

I  not the words that I lack
I  how your eyes look like a ca 
I ca  get through to you
I ca  get through to you
 l be real with you
Hard times, baby, I need—
Hard, hard, hard, baby, I need help


HIGH STRANGENESS 
DELETEVERSE

Today  l write about my cat
Sittin' in my kitchen
Would you like that?
I know sometimes   a bore
And moody at best
I can be a drag
GothBoiClique
I know   confused a lot
Two people, one command
Do what thou will with me
I know not what I am


DELETEVERSE

Most often,   normal, and hold you next to me
But some nights   under the spell of darker beings
Magic practitioner
Symbols I know as true
Turn my computer off
I jump on top of you
Reveal my inner self, the path is always back to you


DELETEVERSE

So wha  up
Do we have
Enough time
Between us
But...

DELETEVERSE

I saw you in a dark room covering' your head
So you might be unaware that I came in through the back
I thought you knew me from the start and that I was into bad things
I guess that I was wrong though,   sorry about that
Magic practitioner, I jump on top of you


DELETEVERSE

I tore through the fabric of love in four dimensions
In song, I say your name in casting your ascension
Step through to other worlds, unknowing where it leads me to
Reveal my inner self, the path is always back to you
In secrets that tie us apart from everything
High strangeness


WHA  THE POINT OF ANYTHING 
DELETEVERSE

I can be there
I saw it there
But, I do  know
 l have to call you later
  sorry


DELETEVERSE

Tell me, say   a God, I do  feel like one
I feel like   stuck here waitin' for a text back
Wha  a conversation?
Tell me what is true love,   tryin' to find that

Never could I escape havin' brought you down
I want more, you keep your heart a secret
I had somethin' till I went and lost it
And now i  totally abandoned


DELETEVERSE

I think her blood is toxic, tha  why she wo  let me in
I called her old roommate just to hear what sh  say
And if ther  passion in you,   tryin' to find it
And if I ca  have what I want, wha  the point of anything?


DELETEVERSE

Tell me why   in pain, why I feel ashamed?
To want love and all of its burdens
To take and totally possess her
And still, I wait for invitations

DELETEVERSE

I thought if I dreamt it then something might happen
I tried to light a candle, it came back to burn me
And if ther  passion in you,   tryin' to find it
And if I ca  have what I want, wha  the point of anything?


It Takes 
DELETEVERSE

I  so convincin' how you breathe down my neck
  back to you like   so sure that the ego side is my best
And   back to honor that
And you keep ridin' all on me i  like that
Pummel me, i  like that
So convinced that   dead
Body wet
  over feelin' bad for you like   spent
Bod  like   mad at you, but still in love with that attitude
I  back to you
I do what I have to do
I  my debt
Felt your mouth on my neck
On your knees for my set
Meet me on the other side
Put me in pain
It takes, takes, takes from my body
I still miss you, baby
Meet me on the other side
Put me in pain
It takes, takes, takes from my body
I still miss you, baby


I Reach Out to You in Song 
DELETEVERSE

I feel my hands numb
Wha  the point of beds if you destroy all of that?
Seven gang, seven marks you left on my skin
 e got a friend, but a friend is all that she is


DELETEVERSE

She has her secrets
And  e mine, w e matched up when it comes to lies
Let me in, let me off when  e reddened eyes
Do  be surprised
Do  be surprised, i  not on you, i  on I and I
And I would laugh at all of it, if I was sure it was  mine
Something will break
Somethin' will break, just not my heart and just not tonight
She has her secrets
And  e mine, w e matched up when it comes to lies


DELETEVERSE

And I ca 
Even feel
Any love
Anymore
You know this song
You know this song
You know this song

DELETEVERSE

She has control now
Passin' on, I reach out to you in song, passin' on
Passin' on, I reach out to you in song, passin' on
Passin' on, passin' on
Passin' on, passin' on
Passin' on, I reach out to you in song, passin' on
You know this song, you know this song

  Not Gonna Do It 
DELETEVERSE

, in pain, , in love
Baby, I was so connected, but I never had enough
I was not collectin', I was flexin' all my stuff
It was there, I did it all under the guise of boomin' up
You do  put me in pain, I do it on my own
I saw evas, gods and centerfolds, now I see me alone
Girl laden apartment, like a vision never known
Call me like as soon as you get home
  doin' fuckin' nothin',   just waitin' for the check
And i  all about the money, so   waitin' for the sex
So I keep collectin' bands, pretend   in the rave
I do  think about it often, but ther  money bein' made
Back up on your bed, do you see   always here?
Ther  snipers to the west of us, so do it, bite my ear
Now i  like   blood, now i  like yo e gone
I thought I would call you over, that was wrong


DELETEVERSE

  not,   not gonna do it,   not,   not gonna do it
  not,   not gonna do it,   not,   not gonna do it

  not,   not gonna do it,   not,   not gonna do it
  not,   not gonna do it,   not,   not gonna do it
  not,   not gonna do it,   not,   not gonna do it

  not,   not gonna do it,   not,   not gonna do it
  not,   not gonna do it


Together 
DELETEVERSE

Thrashing of the bones
I can never sleep
I wish that I could pay someone to care for me
Honestly...
The girls of the world leave me room to breathe
When you think about me do it in your sleep
Privately...
Death is in the air
I  hotter than yo  think
I wish that I could pay a friend to buy me drinks


DELETEVERSE

Sad to be alive and when   by your side
In my heart and eyes, w e connected mind to mind
Together


DELETEVERSE

Visions of your chest
Shadow of the past
Esoteric fragments of a spell I cast
Heavy on wine
The comfort of a bed
Things I find myself drawn to in times of stress
Life subservient to conflict and to death
Final breath

DELETEVERSE

Sad to be alive and when   by your side
In my heart and eyes, w e connected mind to mind
Together
(Together, forever)


Waiting Here

Crystalline skies show Satur  waning
Why am I always waiting here?
No command to pull me together
Wh  the directive so unclear?

Crystalline skies show Satur  waning
Why am I always waiting here?
No command to pull me together
Wh  the directive so unclear?
Tell me what to align to, baby
Something is in my house this year
Histor  what we make it, baby
Maybe this time  l stay right here
Crystalline skies show Satur  waning
Why am I always waiting here?
No command to pull me together
Wh  the directive so unclear?


DELETEVERSE

iPhone on mute, in the back room
Never come through, I ca 
What is this for? Maybe   bored
Maybe  e tied my hands
Or maybe  e found myself
Underneath all the moons
Curvature lines, shattered through time
Maybe i  not my plan
First I put a light on for you
Then I draw a bath myself
Sometimes   aligned within you
Other times,   someone else
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in
Crystalline skies show Satur  waning
Why am I always waiting here?


THERE WAS A FEELING 
DELETEVERSE

?
You know I love you
Some nights
Tell me what you want
  on my own, I can do more
Alone,   not worried about it
Alone, le  go


DELETEVERSE

And I cannot even pretend to feel your love
When   dying just to see you in my bed
And I spoke to you, but   not even aware
There was a feelin', and that feelin' was  right

And I cannot even pretend to feel your love
When   dying just to see you in my bed
And I spoke to you, but   not even aware
There was a feelin', and that feelin' was  right

Would you say feelings are forever in a flash?
If we were honest with each other for a second
When I cannot even remember what I said
Can you really count on me to be forever?


DELETEVERSE

And have you ever tried to cut me like a knife?
Can you see how my heart is at an intersection?
If yo e a path, then i  the one I want to take
I  not the distance that keeps both of us away
Have you ever really said yo e had enough?
A conversation tha l lead me back to you
Tell me, have you ever missed being on top?
I ca  remember when it ever really--

I do  remember spendin' nights being alone
I cast a sigil that was charged in midnight hours
I have  thought about the way I felt the knife
Ca  say I ever really looked into your eyes

Ca  say enough about the way I feel your heartbeat racin' out
So, why do  you tell me that yo e down?
Come on, wo  you tell me   the one?
Why do you pretend yo e not in love?

...
Ca  say enough about the way I feel--
My hear  in the background
So, why do  you tell me that yo e down? (that yo e down)


DELETEVERSE

I told you that   come to you
 l take shots and  l make promises
To put that knife right through you

And you say you had enough
And you ai  have that Lex Luger
Now   really out in Denver, me and Chris will come home soon
(GothBoiClique)

And you told me that yo  stay, that yo  stay
Do  keep pushin' me away
'Cause I had love til I did , then I ca  really explain

My tongue was tied
'Cause I do  have the words to say
That I know that i  forever, and I really want you, baby

Come on


DELETEVERSE

And I cannot even pretend to feel your love
When   dying just to see you in my bed
And I spoke to you, but   not even aware
There was a feelin', and that feelin' was  right

Would you say feelings are forever in a flash?
If we were honest with each other for a second
When I cannot even remember what I said
Can you really count on me to be forever?


DELETEVERSE

And I cannot even pretend to feel your love
Uh...
And I spoke to you, but   not even aware
There was a feelin', and that feelin' was  right
Yeah

Bad Side 
DELETEVERSE

Thought i  be cool if we did  have to all the time
Did  know what I would be missin'
Ther  a lot to take in
I lost track of time
Thought I could fix it
I was mistaken
And now you always have me lookin' at your back so far behind
I know ther  a thing that w e never done
I know we should talk, but   so tired


DELETEVERSE

Have you ever seen me as a God?
Ripped jeans when   at the mall
I dream and it comes to me
Then wake up to nothin' at all
I dream of a cemetery back to you and
My heart beats on and off
  checkin' in for my sake and I-
I really wanna talk, so just help me out


DELETEVERSE

Ooh, baby,   on your bad side
 e got ideas for changin' your mind
(Ooh, baby,   on your bad side)
(Ooh, baby,   on your bad side)

DELETEVERSE

Physically   reachin' out to you and all the time
She says sh  forsaken
Maybe she is
But then so am I
(But then so am I)


DELETEVERSE

Yo e a young light sleeper on the edge of the bed
And   so sedated that I sleep through the night
Do you remember in the pool?
Bod  crashin' into you
Realit  a secret and I-
I really wanna talk but   so alone


DELETEVERSE

Ooh, baby,   on your bad side
Ooooooh oooooh, ooooooh oooooh
Ooh, baby,   on your bad side
Ooooooh oooooh, ooooooh oooooh


Put Me In Graves 
DELETEVERSE

I  over now
Emotions still erratic but   sober now
But if there was a shining road for me to take
  call upon a darker path to show itself
Have you ever seen me act in such a state
In times of stress just go and look the other way
I lost another charger up in Soho House
Before the driver took me to another place
And so...
My head is  straight
  in pain
Take me away


DELETEVERSE

And throw me in the midst of lust
Pray the label covers us
It feels like my bed is a hospital bed


DELETEVERSE

The time is now
For me to claw myself away from pain and doubt
And carry on my shoulders what I started when
Pleasing you was all I really was about
Maybe yo  have someone if I left you then
And so I keep in mind you might have gone away
Or taken on another perso  blood to drink
I think that the arrangement we both have is great
I  death at whom I stare
I think sh  unaware
And so my heart is enlarged and enflamed
Put me in graves

DELETEVERSE

And throw me in the midst of lust
Pray the label covers us
It feels like my bed is a hospital bed


DELETEVERSE

Throw me in the midst of lust
Throw me in the midst of lust


Suffer On Yeah
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes I need in the night
Ther  a path there
  unknowing
What is back there on the other side
All I can do is the same
Tha  the price I pay
Because I love her all of the time
When   giving
When   restless
When   waiting for her to signal twice
If this is the last time
 l make it the best time and crystallize time
  tethered

Go ahead
Lead me on
Go and put your head on my stomach
And bring me to life

The pact we made is Faustian and not without heavy head
 l have what I want but not without consequence
Bought
Sold
Tongue is tied
Lead a different life
Take a different road
And settle...
Settle me down, girl
  not meant for stress of this kind and my head hurts
The lesson here
No one ever fall in love again
I guess that if yo e got it lock it up

Is it public, the need in my life
Am I desperate and grieving
Constantly stressed for no reason or meaning?
Let me inside
And finally caved on Saturday night
And I think I need to tell my friends about it
How natural it seemed
To be present
In the moment
Not trapped by the past
This will change us
Wo  it
And in all honesty
I can honestly say that yo l stand next to me

The mystery is gone
Curtains are gone
Totally
Visibly
Exposed and it seems that   outside in darkness
Beyond the trees
I am waiting
Can you see me
How can I tell you where I have been lately
Dimensions away and void of all patience
Bought
Sold
Tongue is tied
Lead a different life
Take a different road

Suffer on
Suffer on
Suffer on...


When Will It End 
DELETEVERSE

And I ca  get an answer
When   high at the mixer
I found what   good at
I  you and   on that
No, girl,   a live wire
Wha  death but an option
Wha  love separation

Wicca Phase Springs Eternal


DELETEVERSE

And you like the pull from the back
You like to be on the attack
Wha  love dedication?

You liked my songs in the past
You used to like when I talked to you bad

When will it end?…

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Tie it up, would that be wrong?
Must be the heat that makes my throat hurt in the mornin'
 e been wakin' up hot in my own bed
And you always turn your back, but I do  even want to talk about it
Like i  your new way to attack
Show you I have it, I pay everything in cash
You tie me up, so  l react
 e been callin' out to you, but   gettin' no response and   like...
If ther  a crisis, i l be the last one
And if I die I hope i  in front of a mirror
 e got a girl, but i  super so platonic
 e got a friend, but i  really not convincing
He calls me up and I will say that you were not that down
Bodies on the ground, lights really out
Bodies on the ground



Contact 
DELETEVERSE

I do  get enough sleep
Paranoid being
I heard the rain but I thought I heard keys
I could  see if there was cameras on me
  afraid to make contact
  afraid to make contact, woah
Wha  a month when the whole year is bad?
Had a bad couple nights, but   back
Yeah   back to the secrets we kept
I kind of like how the ca  in the bag
And I like how she acts like a cat
And I know that i  not what I want
What I want is her love to myself
What I want is for her to react
  going back to bed
  going back to the water
I feel more pain than I mention
Saw light shine through on the altar (Come on, come on)
See through
Do more for you than I need to
I feel like you wear a mask when I meet you
Shadows in the yard, what do we do?


DELETEVERSE

Another mess last week
Chaos in me
If this is love why is it hard for me to breathe
Do  want no one to have advantage over me
I want you totally
Symbiotic being
Saw you in soft light looking at me
Felt you in past tense leaning on me
I feel a crisis looming over me
  afraid to make contact
'Cause your tone might change
Might forget my name
  afraid to make contact, woah

DELETEVERSE

  afraid to make contact
  afraid to make contact, woah


Scars on Me 
DELETEVERSE

Come on
Act like you really know
Hands keep me out of the smoke (Lederrick)
Said you know me like all the time
 l tie your hands
Said you know me like that
Said you know me like that
Said you know me always
I  fine
Keep your head, tha  fine
Tell me what you want
What am I really after?
Eyes so cold
My legs so cold
I need to know you want me
Nah, not at all
Me and nothing else, 
DELETEVERSE
   sorry
If you knew me like right, not right
GothBoiClique


DELETEVERSE

I  hard to place my hands around it
Light the candle, find the passion
Take another, passin' onward
I know what I like, legs and shoulders
And I wish I had a place in L.A
But I also want a place with you
There came a time when you were pushin' me away
And another when you push me through
I collapse when I think about you
And everything I hid from you, you knew
So call me out on that
Change the past around

DELETEVERSE

Eyes closed, so cold
You put me in choke holds
I cast a sigil and my eyes burn blood
I got scars on me, no love
Swear I need to know you want me


I Fell
DELETEVERSE

I do  sleep ’cause my hea  on fire
I hate creeps, and I hate liars
Oh, youwanta grave keptsecret that I never tell
  upin heaven but I came from hell


DELETEVERSE

I fell
So did you

DELETEVERSE

It does  matter what came before
I felt pain and I wanted more
Oh,   not settled until  e done it all and right
I split my head open again last night


DELETEVERSE

I fell
So did you
I fell
I fell
So did you

DELETEVERSE

I do  sleep cause my hea  on fire
I hate creeps, and I hate liars
Oh, you want a grave kept secret that I never tell
  up in heaven but I came from hell


DELETEVERSE

I came from death,   dead
And torn up flesh
I painted my face white and then it turned out red
I came from nothing
And nothing is where I return
You lit a match, now watch it burn


DELETEVERSE

I fell
So did you
I fell
So did you
I fell
So did you
I fell
I fell
So did you


I Lose Everything 
DELETEVERSE

You know I only like it when the lights' turned out
Silhouette lover in my clique right now
Turns her back to me, like sh  over it
We do  need to talk about it, baby, you can show me it
And we were coolin' in my car in the parkin' lot
I had you forever in a second, like it never stopped
Baby, you know  e got you like down
Solitary ways
I was in a past life
Everythin  safe
I could  collect myself
I ca  remember what I was sayin', I remember how it felt
One time,   the one
Passionate summer
I  my fault that yo e gone, silhouette lover
And I want you right now, so bad
I was projectin' myself onto you in the back
I was pretendin' that   your man
Baby,   a fan
Do  push me away
Take me in again


DELETEVERSE

Ther  a California goth with my jacket on
' chick in the background
Just pass it around, i  goin' down
Eyes on me with the cameras out
And   like tell me why you like me through your cell phone
Tell me why you like it when I lose control
Just pass it on my way
And take if you want it
  cool, but it takes from my heart and it breaks it

DELETEVERSE

And   upset, because I lose everything
I lost my title and my passport, everything
I tried to see you and I flaked on everything
I left my mark on it, mistakes on everything
And I keep secrets, like you do  even know me
I went through everything for you to control me
And when I left the club I crashed into everything
Heart like 
Eyes like passionate
I lose everything


Not Like This 
DELETEVERSE

Fantasize bout your legs and thighs
Cut through me with your knives and eyes
Wait for me, til the time is right
I see you there
Lose my mind
And sometimes I go through you there
I looked you up on computers there
Old pictures
New feeli 
New windows up to the ceili  there...
And sometimes   mad at you, but still in love with that attitude
I  back to you
Do you still love me like that?
Call me back...
Do you still love me like that?
Call me back...
Do you still love me like that?
Call me back...
Do you still love me like that?


DELETEVERSE

Do you remember once...
Do you remember once...
Do you remember once when you knew me as the one who was talkin' all the time?
Maybe move to Iceland and out of my apartment, tha  fine...
Wait, wait, wha  that sign
I never really know wha  on your mind...
There never was a feelin' that I knew was real...
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me wha  real...


I Need A Place I Can Rest 
DELETEVERSE

(GothBoiClique)
I was in the back countin' up for baby
'Cause I really want a house for vacation, baby
And I really wanna show you   forever lately
 Pisces gang, pull up black Mercedes
And I pull up touchin' death like nobody save me
I been eyein' up the knife cause it wanna take me
If   a bad man then yo e like half that
Kournikovax on the Instagram


DELETEVERSE

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh woman, oh woman, I can hardly call you mine
Because I know that yo e been lyin'
When the back of your hand gets covered in your eyes
And the sun goes down in a cemetery night
Autograph silhouettes, I know yo e mine
I remember feelin' like yo e always on my mind
All I want (all I want)
Is somethin' that I ca  explain
For you to text me right back


DELETEVERSE

Oh I need a place I can rest
Stab me in the chest and the neck
I used to feel violently alone
Now   tryin' to make it like that

DELETEVERSE

From the flights and the shows
And I travel by myself
And the shows are always tight but my heart is such a mess
Never said you were really fine for my love
Now I step back, Gucci in all black
I was in the back countin' up for baby
'Cause I really want a house for vacation, baby
And I really wanna show you   forever lately
Pull up black Mercedes


DELETEVERSE

Oh I need a place I can rest
From the clubs and the shows
And relationship stress
Tell me, can you unbreak my back?
Tell me where the real love is at


DELETEVERSE

And I find my way back home
When I call you do  answer that
I  the same as it always is
Oh, I need a place I can rest


Life After Death (Stress Beyond Stress) 
DELETEVERSE

How are you even performin'
With broken voice and shattered spine?
I  soul-to-soul inside my head
I  you and you versus I and I
And if you really adored me
Yo  cut me up with razor wire
Yo  call me passionately again
And never say that you were tired


DELETEVERSE

And she knows I keep secrets
And secrets kept me on my own
But I just started work again
So both of us are never home
The week I went to L.A
I could  help but feel alone
Then on the weekend, leave again
So I can shoot the video


DELETEVERSE

Do you like bein' normal?
Do I annoy you all the time?
Feels like  e nothin' left to give
But to leave you unsatisfied
Or maybe I just bore you
It leaves me wonderin' again
If after life, ther  only death
Beyond the smoke tha  in my chest
Beyond the stress, only more stress


JESSE LACEY IN MERCEDES Ther  a vision of an altar now
Me and at once   passin' on and out
It was  somethin' that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
Try to find the time when I had changed
Somethin' tells me that you thought it out
Had me thinkin' about when I became
Jesse Lacey in Mercedes' now
Ther  a vision of an altar now
Me and at once   passin' on and out


Overdose 
Ooh baby i  good to see you again
Past time and through dimensions
If you all want change then mind still might
Ther  nothing there in her reflection
I need time to collect myself
And not add myself to her collection
Wha  the past?
  not in it
Why ca  I read her expression?
I still wanna be bad with you
Even though you never really asked me to
A change that does  last
A pain that never ends
Ther  a person that  l never know
Tell me why  l never get the answer though
If I step back, will you step back?
I  deadbeat on her comprehension



Stop Torturing Me 
DELETEVERSE

First time in a while


DELETEVERSE

First time in a while that I have  been bored
First time in a while,  e been able to record
(First time in a while) In bated breath, I would open up the door
When you were cold I made sure you were alive
First time in a while that I have  been online
First time in a while, I took you by surprise
(First time in a while) You took in all of it, tha  what I like
Ther  a person I forgot about, it happens all the time


DELETEVERSE

Can you feel it deeper, wrapped around your spine?
To you then back to me, ther  a secret we both keep
I was passionately on about it, know that you wo  leave
You are you and I am me, 
You are you and I am me


DELETEVERSE

First time in a while
GothBoiClique


DELETEVERSE

First time in a while that I have  been bored
First time in a while, first time in a while

DELETEVERSE

I feel somehow   connected
I feel you for real and how yo e so selective
Baby, do  push away, I said from the beginnin'
If I knock real slow, will you answer? No
I feel ther  a separation
  not who I was in 
But I stay attuned to what yo e really after
Does your heart beat slow when I call you? No
First time in a while


Looks WICCAPHASEVERSE
Yeah,   useless
Døves, Døves, Døves
Saw you in the back

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Did you feel me hold my breath
Put my back to your chest?
Yeah, I  fine, but i  really not fine
(So I said) if it feels like death, then it must be death
And your sign wo  agree with my sign
Maybe   useless, baby,   useless
Think of you in past lies, not in a past tense
That girl is ruthless
My bloody valentine
I put a new necklace on her neckline
I cannot align myself (saw you in the back)
I cannot explain why   so in pain
And I will not deny   in hell
Esoteric rays, when I say your name
Feelings come in waves, but they spell my death out
I do  wanna talk about what it does to my health now
  callin' on you for help
  callin' on you, never ending flame

Until I Walk Through the Flames 
DELETEVERSE

A darker kind of love is what I give to this
A shadowed conversation on the edge of time
A final kind of crisis in the palm of my hands
A multiversal conflict in my restless mind
You knew me as the one who spoke in passionate lies
The darker twin of someone that you used to know
The feeli  like a code imprinted on your blood now


DELETEVERSE

The fire is directed at my soul, until my eyes close again
Until I walk through the flames


DELETEVERSE

See my eyes shut now
And my brain shut down
See my dark sunglasses as they hit the ground
See my legs shut down (Down, down)
You know me


Does Your Head Stop Does your head stop when you go to bed
I know no one else that works as much as you work
  make time for you again
Maybe when yo e back in love factor me into your plans

What are they?
I wo  go there

I  depression, honestly
There is nothing I can do to not feel heavy
If I looked back I would see
The best parts of you  e been missing lately

I  depression and it takes over totally
I think that   a fake in mind and body

If we did talk, when would it be?
Right when you get home from work
Before you have to sleep
Conversation needs time to breathe

Heart that wo  stop
Let me be
I know no one else that hurts as much as I hurt

In times of stress I panic because I do  want you to leave
I do  know what is real and so I question everything
My heart will not shut up
I say and honestly
I ca  love you enough in mind and body


SLEEPER 
DELETEVERSE

All the parts of me that lived inside
Are drowning in the sea of waking life


DELETEVERSE

Ice on me, put the car in park
Chew black pepper and I cross my heart
At a crossroads there, so you cross your arms in a darkness there where you cast your charms...
Want you there
Need you bad
Call me when your lips are black
Call me when your eyes are closed
Credit cards and shoppin' bags
The sigil is your third eye casted in a silhouette
I want you in nothin'
I think  a pay for that
Calls me "Corinthiaxxx"
She calls me by name
When they fly me out to L.A. call me "California Phase"
In a black two-seater and I cross two lanes
  the one that called, yo e the one that came
I want to be so down for your act
In a darker kind of rhythm, can you love me to the max?
In a colder kind of feelin' like you have me in your trap
Girl, I want you now
Do  do me like that

I Wake Up In Pain 
DELETEVERSE

In a serious way to start the day
I wake up in unknowing
I wonder what haunts this house
Woe is me
Depression in passionate phrase
The tiger in me is untamed
So hate me but do  go away
I wake up in pain


DELETEVERSE

The connection is tenuous at best
And weighing on my chest
The best times have all come and gone (Come on, come on)
Tell me where I have gone wrong


DELETEVERSE

Go back to a past life
I had you up all night
You like me right
Help me turn my systems on
Go back to a past life
And heal me with your light


DELETEVERSE

In the way that I hold on to a feeling too long
I hold on to you and in song
I feel you growing tighter
I wonder if yo e all but gone
I love you but I notice something wrong
The past is not only a place
I give you your time and your space
So you can have all to my name
I wake up in pain

DELETEVERSE

Ther  times when   cold and   afraid
Ther  times when I ca  stay
Help me back from where  e gone
Tell me where have I gone wrong


DELETEVERSE

Go back to a past life
I had you up all night
You like me right
Help me turn my systems on
Go back to a past life
And heal me with your light


Look at Yourself 
DELETEVERSE

DELETEVERSE

Hi again, this is me, at home I am
So wide awake, depressed for a lifetime
Coffe  up, my second cup, who gives a fuck?
  up at eight,   in bed by midnight
Made the bed, passing time, put laundry in
I think i  great: domestic in my life
I  raining now, like everytime that we go out
  not divine, ca  change it, but  l try


DELETEVERSE

Failing laugh, failing smile, , likes
No ego here, i  only been a year, right?


DELETEVERSE

In a strange way
Think   back to myself
When   back here
I know nobody else
Is nobody there?
Me and you alone
When you leave for work
When I sleep at home
Yeah, it hurts me
Just to leave and come back
Hey, come back here
Need your help to relax

DELETEVERSE

So I guess toda  the day I make a break
My heart, it craves attention and spotlight


Mystery 
DELETEVERSE

Everything is not what it should be
Thought it would be fine but   not yet
I cannot explain what I ca  see
Shadow in my heart, tha  a mystery
Here I stand alone, but i  not me
Tethered to my heart from the onset
This is all a consequence of being mine
Mirror thirty nine, you are nine three


DELETEVERSE

When   not here, where do I go?
When   not with you?
Where does time go?
(Where does time go?)
  guarded,   unknown
Did I wait too long?
Or is time slow?
Do I know you? What do I know?
So the madness starts to manifest now
Here and now,   holding what eluded me
Hearing from the past but i  not yet
Path of the Gnostics, Babylon, you and me
Simulated mind, now inside of me
Something in the way I see myself is confusing me
Waiting here in pain, come deliver me
Time away from you (misery)

DELETEVERSE

Everything is not what it should be
Thought it would be fine but   not yet
I cannot explain what I ca  see
Shadow in my heart, tha  a mystery
Here I stand alone, but i  not me
Tethered to my heart from the onset
This is all a consequence of being mine
Try to find Gematria at thirty nine
Mirror thirty nine, you are nine three


StoneColdStunner WICCAPHASEVERSE
Third eye open and telling me   numb
Find me tripping on cemetery love
Girls like me cause I look like Bones
Triple six fiending like California clones
See me, shut up
Tell me nothing
Eyes like crystal
Stone cold stunner
Eyes like crystal
Stone cold stunner


SHE DOES  BELIEVE IN THELEMA 
DELETEVERSE

She said sh  put shots in my back
I did  even think to believe her though
I said that   with her and in death
She does  believe that I need her though
She does  believe in thelema
Shoutout Key Nyata and Selena
She said sh  put shots in my back
I did  think sh  do me like that
Back up the line
I passed out again
I  hard to believe
That you ca  understand
I want more than love
And she ca  understand
Why I need the attention
From shows and my band
I see Audrey in Shelly and Adam in Bobby
I moved from the learjet and into the Audi
Yo e Marjorie Cameron
  Aleister Crowley
You know i  forever
Tha  Adam and Audrey
There was a woman in the back of my head
I thought I saw you at the show and i was right
I said that this would be the last one til the next
I could  breathe in with the stabbin' in my spine
I thought it so obvious the way it seemed
Ther  no difference between what you did to him and what yo e doin' to me
I spent months like tryin' to get it back
But I can not stand bein' here alone
I ca  breathe when sh  not answerin' her phone


Return Year 
DELETEVERSE

Something takes a hold of me again
Something tries to take away the time that we have
And I wish that I could hold you but I ca 
I wish that I could see you everyday but I ca 
I do  wanna wallow but I am
I do  wanna leave my house again, but I am
And I wish that I could hold you but I ca 
I wish that I could see you everyday but I ca 


DELETEVERSE

In my life ther  struggles of which I ca  identify
In my heart I see you as someone I have always liked
Now I think I might have found the one
Sinister in being and in mind
I return to something that I never knew beyond
In a daze around you in a moment  l be gone
The hardest part of being by myself
Never knowing how  l spend my nights
And now  e hurt, I am hurt
I  painful to keep on pushing through
  present forever, I give myself entirely to you
  moving and forward, ther  nothing but for her
I ca  stop when I should
The past is Saturn and i  always back to you

DELETEVERSE

Something takes a hold of me again

Reluctant,   here now

Come back here, another round
Return year, return year

If something was the same, now i  not dear

Everyday is long when yo e not here
Must be hard to be the best, yes, yes, yes
Lost myself inside and I do  care
I still lift you up when i  hard to
Yo e inside my mind and I do  care

Go  Country 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Drive the pathway through the pines
And the moors of mystery
Welcome conflict and let crisis come
And shake the ground beneath
And the family secret hiding
In the farmhouse down the street
Rushes open door on your front porch
And shadows me
Taken and entirely I embraced the bonny beast
Over hills and highlands, we rode hard the passing peaks
Danger like the virgin wife, beside me she would sleep
Cherry was her da  truck that she crashed at seventeen
I kneel before what temper broke the branches on the beach
And those thrilling highs and southern nights are always out of reach

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I learned a lesson
I need to pray hard, final hours
Take care of me god
Take care of me god

Lake of Fire 
DELETEVERSE

What were you thinkin' last night, all night?
You were in and still like outside
You were once in pageants, I know
You were in the club lights, I know


DELETEVERSE

You were in the past tense, so slowed
I was right there with you though
Feeli  came like heavy then
I want tongue and nothin' else
I want you like bad
Come to me in violent ways and ca  even react
Actin' selfish in the back
Takin' selfies in all black
So, you were under club lights, so cool
I was right there with you too


DELETEVERSE

I saw you without pretense years ago
You were in the club like so cold

Cry for me, die for me, I know you will


DELETEVERSE

With your legs on my hands
I  cool,   a fan
I thought about leavin' once and never again
I thought I was passionate, like   passionate, man
In shadows, I stand
In shadows,   next to you
Wha  your number and plans
In visions I come to you when yo e out with yo e friends
Or out without friends
And I call, but the cell is off and I miss you, again
  tied to your hands
  tethered to everything

What were you thinkin' last night, all night?

You say i  on me, no, i  not on me
You shoul e had that

Believe it when I say...
Ther  snipers to the west side
I saw you like a model...
But actually a real one
That was in Seattle...

I keep pressin' on though
The point is yo e a charmer...
I talk to you in past tense
Is that what you want? Yeah


DELETEVERSE

Back to the way that you put me in pain
When you say i  not enough
Come here, baby
In the last two years, it was everything I gave you...
In the last two years, it was everything I gave you...
I want your legs wrapped around me tightly and now
My girl is cool, like the baddest around
And I will wait, wait, wait by my phone for you now
Callin' late
Call in passionate sound...
I said I was right, though I saw you act elusive in sin
Feel me once by your legs and within
I wait for you to say
I need you more than once
And yo e callin' me back
I  a question of enough
I say i  addin' up...
Me is who I love


Do  Get Me Started 
DELETEVERSE

I  hard to look back at me when your back is broken
  an animal when deprived indecency
Ther  a tiger and it lives inside of me
Wanna be better, but my heart has spoken
Had a woman until that woman was stolen
Gone is my baby and she has taken a part of me
She was a part of me, in my vapid celebrity
Tried to appeal it, but a decision was chosen


DELETEVERSE

If ther  a sigil then i  not mine
Dead again
And I helped you sleep and  e got you back
We do  speak cause you do  react
Soul to soul like
I saw your marki  on me again
What is life if   so in pain?
If it comes to death will you let me in?


DELETEVERSE

If ther  a sigil then i  not mine
Dead again
And I try to see you in a past life
Its hard to sleep at night
Have you ever seen the way my heart it breaks
And I try to see you in a past life...

DELETEVERSE

My lack of sincerity
Battles me at the altar, and I
Kept you away from me
Thought of you as a silhouette
My heart beati ails in

Emotional rapture
Emotional rap-do  get me started
Do  get me started
Do  get me started...


How Could You Not Like That 
DELETEVERSE

And though   like you push me away, i  fine...
  guaranteed to upgrade out of my apartment
And you hide your past from me, i  fine

Still I drop back on your heart, cause   your man
But   glowin' up...
Like , baby
Will you still want me when   in Mercedes', baby?
Would you like that?
I think you would like that
How could you not like that...

I  hard to even breathe when yo e around


Like   Tom May 
DELETEVERSE

Boulevard apartment
That was in , when I drove you back from Philly then
You were with me there in secret
I was markin' out for that feelin'

And I hate to make you feel morally in debt
I wish you were on my arm
Want you tattooed on my neck
I hate to make you feel more than depressed
Baby,   correctin' this mess


DELETEVERSE

Because this summer  e had enough
I took too much
And I did  see you enough
(And I did  eat enough)
Crashed my car on Keyser, like   Tom May
Playin' twisted metal, like   Kanye


DELETEVERSE

Movin' through these attitudes
Like we could not be speakin', then and still I come right back to you
I hate to make you feel more than incensed
  pullin' up with the best
See the prices goin' up
And I start to fade away
Final crisis of the heart passin' over me again
And I try to call you back, but ca  remember anything
Yo e the CD in my car
Yo e the phone that never rings
And I hate to hold on restless feeli 
I crashed my car on Keyser, like   Tom May
Thank you, Black Kray...

Icy Waters (I Hate Myself Too) 
DELETEVERSE

Will you meet me in the gravity of nothing?
Threw away back so I can taste the Jäger
Saw your pale white eyes wide
I was sitting alright
I really hate my life
And I ca  wait to die
I drank the water but it did  stop my shaking

And in the burden through the unnecessary wonder
Try to stay awake ca  remember nothing
A lot of folks out there screaming they do  love me
I do  love them either i  a different kinda hate though
To me my nights are better slowly contemplated
Ways to make it smoother and I toss tomorrow
I know where you where you think it all
Sometimes I know that ther  hate but I do  think about it
Come back to me with your collarbones showing
I want an end to this darker kinda rainbow
Tha  why I keep myself inside the crystal bottom
The pain in my heart tonight its not for you
But the darkness as I ca  ignore


DELETEVERSE

I want to feel you die then I want to die too (x)
Too (x)
I used to scream once
Now   screaming double
I used to feel pain in my living, man
Now I think i  dying slowly
Travel icy waters so you never sleep alone without me
Travel icy waters just to keep you coming


Stress 
DELETEVERSE


WICCAPHASEVERSE
No longer a man, I am the artist now
Visibly engaging, visibly stressed out
I ca  understand what   upset about
My world has a dome and yo e atop it now
My baby has serpent eyes and I can feel them from behind
And I wish I had thought different but i  not my sign
Restless yet again, nothin  ever right
I feel guilty every time that   not home at night
But the arts we practice here are of a different kind
See, it really takes a lot for me to take wha  mine
Heart is in the way, beating through my spine
But I do  think that   ever gonna cross that line

WICCAPHASEVERSE
You treated me like you do  care
And something upsets me about it

WICCAPHASEVERSE
You treated me like you do  care
And something upsets me about it
'Cause you need me and  l be there
Until   too weak,  l be there

Until   too weak,  l be there

Caffeine 
DELETEVERSE

I hold all nights sacred, I hold up my bet
Till days with no direction plagued me once again
I tell you   down and I want something more
You wonder, you whisper, you do 
With this romanticism filling up my chest
You ask me if   ready, no, of course not yet
I see you seven days, but then not for 
The longing, the waiting routine (yeah)
When only thinking about you does  seem to help
I like to stay in the back and being by myself
I like to stay in the back and be by myself
This new initiation comes as no surprise
Dark baptism, open up my eyes
When every day is long, and still I run out of time
Whose cycle, whose pattern? Not mine
What you call pleasure really hurts my head
A call of ballads mixed with real-life dread
I know that   strange and I...
Know that yo e the one I like
  not like them other boys
  not like those other guys


DELETEVERSE

When the waking up ritual is  working out
  in need of a blessing and I need caffeine now (in need of a blessing and I need caffeine now)
When the will of another leaves me in chains
 l do surgery on myself today
When   not beside you,   wasting time
When   not beside you, where am I to mind
When only thinking about you does  seem to help
I like to stay in the back and be by myself
Suffer alone and be by myself

DELETEVERSE

I know that   strange and I...
Know that yo e the one I like
I know that   strange and I...
Know that yo e the one I like


Beloved 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Honestly, I think toda  the day I die
And you sleep through it all
'Cause yo e been throwin' up all night
But, tha  fine
Honestly, w e both sick to our stomach
Honestly, I love it
Honestly, if I could take it back I would chase you back
Nothin' ever seems to matter really
And now the curtains close (do  go)
Now my heart beats slow
GothBoiClique, take my soul
No on l know

WICCAPHASEVERSE
GothBoiClique, heart so cold
 a die alone
(Nothing ever seems to matter really)
Money comin' in, medicine in hand
Sippin' antidote
I finally found my home
But  e been so alone
I  like   livin' on the road
Like I always overdose
Like   always comatose
Like you ca  ever get close
Like you ca  find the pulse
But yo e still takin' off my clothes
Like yo e searchin' for a soul
Just bury me in guilt
Set fire to this home
I swear, I never wanted it
I never should have called
Unholy are the ghosts
In hospital walls
Who hang over my head (  always)
And remind me   alone (cut open)


Obsessed This late in the day, throw caution aside
Who cares what I say?
Not shocked or ashamed,concernedstill am I
Icrave what I crave
Love up tomy knees and then overhead
Just praise when you speak
Though privilegedIfight,though passive itseems
Desire to please,insatiable someone
And the chance to get to make out
Is this a sign that   obsessed?
An obvious yes
Past spells I cast have paid out
I truly need attention bad
  just too shy to ask

Remembering when I came to believe in passion again
A name tha  in jest though seriously
My love is expressed,   serious baby
My life is a LARP now
Though really inside you
  really this person
You turned me inside out
Do  ask me about him
You know more than I do
I  best to keep silent bout what he had gone through
You see, blood runs cold in the comfort of the backroom
Do you actually think I woul e made it this far without you?
I was raised by Polish Catholics
No one taught me how to sing, obviously
Dear Spotlight, you can go now
  tired of what this life can bring
And bored of everything

I move forward and back in time I swear
This time yo e at the center
One life and a single breath
I  all so deep, this time together

Eyes closed in contradiction
Lif  passion, life is pain
I  one in the same
This past on  been a bad one
I question how w l carry on
My will has not been strong, at least not since our last time
Is this a sign that   obsessed?
An obvious yes
Past spells I cast have paid out
I truly need attention bad
  just too shy to ask


COOL 
DELETEVERSE

I  a cruel world
But i  cool


DELETEVERSE

Yo e so champagne
  a charmer, self-harmer,   in pain
Got shadows in my brain, whiskey in my veins
Ran a couple blocks to see if I could call your name
Whispered on your leg, cigarette stained breath
Got me with that vain hex, slow death, same sex
I want this forever, followed you into that main bed
Curl up for hours in your veins til   painless
Feelin' like   paintdeath, all marble floors
Bottles in the bath and yo e hangin' on my door
Palm springs like that, Summer Roberts with the Coors
Friends seein' glass, white powder, crystal court
You and I in the all white Benz, chasin' street
Cold Har  friend with that interview on Noisey
(Vice on me, like   GBC)
Girls whisper in the back seat
Is that Wicca Phase on this THRAXX beat


DELETEVERSE

Call me in the bed last night
Call you to the back right
Call you personally
You put me on hold last week
Hide the drugs in your bag (Gucci)
  about my weed
You ca  get off the phone with me
Eyes on me
Hold you down for keeps
I whisper now that I feel weak
Charmer on repeat
I got scars on me
Tie me there
Slow come on
An icy kind of breathin' so come on
Everything is hard where I belong
Just so you know that I miss someone

DELETEVERSE

I ca  trust a single soul now
I ca  trust a single soul
Girl, you gotta hit my phone like
Are you still at home like? like
Are you still alone like me? like
Just because yo e just like me
I might catch your sympathy
But I like when you look at me
Blunts lit up,   in the backseat
But I like it when you look my way
So  l see you when   back in LA


Pull It Forward You see once I was sure, now   not so sure
I ca  find the paththatwill take meforward
 e fallen and hard, everybody knows
I my will to ascend and be so much more
Put yourhandsaroundmy neck andpull it forward
(Putyour hands around my neck and pull it forward)

A man that wants you bad, unrelenting force
(  sitting bad, though really new)
Angel stare, devil of a body though
(  with you now, just tell me where)
I wo  let just anybody take control (no)
Cause I do  trust anybody anymore (no)
Put your hands around my neck and pull it forward

Blackened vision and so tongue tied
Heartbeat shallow and hard to find
Back to living in water again
Back to giving you all, I try
I curse my sorrow in blackened room
I give my whole self to you

Obsessed with what my bad other half can bring
(  so done with the past, take a hold of me)
Bad is what I missed, bad is everything
(  serious, stand over me)
To find what I have lost ( e severed, baby)
Flirtatious and obscene (  tethered, baby)
Put your legs around my waist, return to me
(To torture me, forcefully)
In the night I can see you clearly days I do  see you at all
(Tell the world that   in a bad way, waiting for it)
But the wait is inconsequential, I can see clear it pays off
(Finally I found the path,   escaping towards it)
Holding out for love is pain (  indebted to it)
Like   hanging from a string (forever, truly)
Time for her to feel me up (I know it, baby)
Time for me to do the same (I know it, baby)
Put your hands around my neck and say my name


Icebreaker

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I had love once, I tried to escape it
You do  know wha  real though, I know how to fake shit
I knew how to make my heart keep breakin'
Caught up in a dark way, left my ego broken
You knew how to keep things left unspoken
You put me in bad ways, I was all emotion
I wish I could sleep my vice to the ocean
Yo e on some evil shit, use your body to kill me quick

Misery


Just So You Know WICCAPHASEVERSE
Just so you know, I been passed around
Silence has  changed, baby, you still hear me out
For me like once, baby, call me now
Ther  passion in the way you put me in the ground
Silence and blank stare
I  like I wish I coul e been there
Just so you know I been caught, baby, stackin' up bands
Do you remember nights when I showed up unplanned?
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Ther  snipers to the West,  a hold up my hands
Ther  something in the way that you call me "your man"
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know

Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know

WICCAPHASEVERSE
When I think   coming back
I feel better but i  strange
Thought I saw you from afar
You cast a spell on me, a charm
I wait for you in pain
Nights slipping and the light stays flickering time
Pour you water and I look you right in the eyes
I  not the same when   away
Girl, I need you face to face
Glad we finally got arranged
  saying, baby
Something keeps me separated
Something keeps me inside
Something keeps me in a lock box, tongue tied
Baby, listen when I say
Yo e forever what I want
I ca  think of you enough
I promise that   coming round
Coming round
I know you are the best around


So Down 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I wanna be so down for your act
In a darkened kind of rhythm can you love me to the max
I got a feeling that puts me under attack
GothBoiClique counting money In the back
  so down cause I love the sound of your heartbeat ticking and the passion now
I wo  lie cause i  not allowed
And wha  you do to my mind
Cause I ca  figure it out


Sirens WICCAPHASEVERSE
See me go back and forth
This is not self control
Trapped in a mild state
Settled inmyold ways
Never beenhere   sure
Never this far before
Eventhough   unsafe
Oddly   not afraid
Then I go on andcave
HowdoI speak tome
Only in harshertones
Only so I ca  breathe
I do this to myself
Speaking in secrets I ca  tell
Put it all on the edge
Picking it up I fell




Tonite I Feel Like Dying 

I Tether WICCAPHASEVERSE
Passin' on, let me go

You put me inside a trap
Credit cards, shoppin' bags
You put me in darker light
Shadows, I turn off the lights
I  how you make me feel at night
Silver blade, body type
Passion like you saw me in rhythm and in death
Ther  no conversation if yo e choosin' up like that
Ther  no inspiration when I call to call me back
Girl, I want you now, do  do me like that
I try to lock it down, I tether
Call you by darker names forever
I want it, so I take it
You cut through me
I can take it so I take it
You cut through me
I can take it so I take it
I can take it

Mixed with headache and trauma
Melodrama and me
For a second  l wait
To reflect on the past
And what a self centered mess  e made


Dead Star   a dead star, frozen to the bone
I  best not to be alone
A depressed star, bounded to a tone
A truth better left unknown
In a castle, I collected coal
Under red skies, I am Satur  own
In a cold night,   returning home
With my last set,   coming home

This is not an option, return to nothing
Returning all  e owned
Leave you with a symbol, help me stay tethered
Help me to keep control
Why is it so hard to be on my own?
Confess something I do  know

  a dead star, frozen to the bone
I  best not to be alone
Ther  a message for you to decode
Was I programmed? Am I a clone?
And in future tenses
We will tense up, arrested
Am I dead yet? I need to know
Lit a single candle
Under red skies,   Satur  own
I  best not to be alone


With Or Without U 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I thought you knew it from the start
I was into bad things, baby like   into you
And when I see you, know that I lose all control
I wish I knew a way to make my heart beat slow
I  all those meetings in my car
And how I knew the right time to tell you that   into you
I still feel that but i  not the same thing, no
She always found a way to keep the lights down low
Alone
Alone is how I left her
A light
I cannot remember
Still I swear that you were true
And I swear that I was also true

Do  forget me because I will forget me too...

Dark Alley 
DELETEVERSE

This time I was quick to find you
I thought I was dead without you
I can hear your voice inside me
Crystal aura does surround you
Ther  bad times  l surrender to
The night touch used to not remember
Nights I felt like death around you
And I cast that out into the nether now
Sever back there
Time moves forward
What here keeps me bound and tethered
Yes,  l be there, darkest corner



Backed Against the Wall in the Back with the Girl 


Fantasize, your legs look tight
Thought you were cool and I know that I was right
Caught up in a game, down the path I will play
I need you so so bad, want you forever, baby
Call you my something and I
Touch you forever, baby
I feel you on my arm, charmer baby
  in the path inside of your head
I know you feel like one with me, girl
All to myself and I feel for you, girl
I can only give myself like so much time
Fuck what I was on, I was only being right
I need you baby, now, and I want it there like bad
I saw your picture from the message that you sent
Cool me like once, got me in the night
Bab  like ice, so   followin' the sign
I am the one with this body in your hands...
To me my nights spent violently low
I know you want to feel all of it again

DELETEVERSE

Backed against the wall in the back with the girl
Tellin' me shes on and I know that bab  right
Tell me somethin' cold like whisper through the pain
Yo e the only one I want in the darkest kind of way
Violence in the red,   the black silhouette
Corinthiax black, darkest Eva yet
You love the way it tastes like I know that yo e in love
I think my numbe  six but I always triple up

Aura 
DELETEVERSE

Split my life in two,   baptized
Both in water and in flame
In passion and in pain
I surrender to the structure
To wha  stable and wha  sane
Wha  here and wha  unchanging
I called outward to the stranger
He called back and by my name
Another simulation, a synchromystic game
I have a partner
And I have her to keep me tame
My unremitting flame


DELETEVERSE

Split my life in two,   tested
I saw myself above the lake house
I saw the sunset, I was by it
I let you know that   awake now
And I remove myself completely
The strangest way to bring you back around
Unnecessary complication
  born a pisces and I hate it

What more can I lend?   a fire burning bad
 e been saying, but it never came to pass
Now I guess it finally has
Tribulation,  e been in i  throes
And if you were in it too
Then you never let it show
In a vague way of filtering what I say
Can you look me into my eyes and say w e not safe?
  engaged and excited by wha  not defined
Charmed by the siren disguised


DELETEVERSE

Split my life in two,   baptized
Both in water and in flame
In passion and in pain
I surrender to the torment
To wha  heavenly and bane
Wha  here and wha  unchanging
I called outward to the stranger
He called back and by my name
Another simulation, a synchromystic game
I have a partner
I have her to keep me tame
My unremitting flame

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I had different feelings I was bumpin' then
Saw you in the back of the Mercedes and I thought   do you in
See I thought differently about you then
I still hear the way that you were bumpin' that Springs Eternal
Drop my phone in Philadelphia, gone over the edge
It was just last night that you lost your head
  a young heartbreaker and   permanently stressed
How is life not death, how am I not dead?
  working on dying, saw you in a past life
Wish that I was back then, you had me up all night
GBC   reckless, crystals are in fragments
You put me in pain in Philadelphia basements

Penelope WICCAPHASEVERSE
I  funny how in the end you took all of my love
And I was fucking faded when I saw you, love
I was boomin' and oppressive
I was acting like I owned that
I was in that uber texting, showing my love
In silence, I was best then
In new ways I could lay you down
Or be passionate laying


Ice Is Me WICCAPHASEVERSE
I never seem my own way
Touch me in silence, baby

Lead me down the path, right?
Let me be the only one
Find me in the back, right?

Control on me
Eyes on me
Lead me down the path again



Housewarming Party 

WICCAPHASEVERSE

Find us in the back, we do  talk with strangers
I like the way the shot tastes, need no chaser

No you were  invited, we call you a traitor
Silly girls act like dumb teenagers
Now my brain hurts

HIGHWAY IN THE NIGHT 
DELETEVERSE

Passion on, je suis, I know
Cool legs are on the right of me

Am I sick today? Do  even know
Winte  like the worst of it
Callin' off, can I? But, no
I just turn my back to it

When you call me from the highway in the night
You put me in pain there, I feel like you know that
It breaks my heart, but  l be fine

Shadows come in from my west
Wo  be home when yo e home

Abercrombie wants you, I feel like I owe you that

You showed me the stand up actually on that shit   like your man, love


DELETEVERSE

And if I led you astray
No i  not for all night

Passionate Yet 


(GothBoiClique)
To me the caveat is gold, I wait for your legs to control my hold
Or maybe for your head to control your throat
My hands are always for your throat, and you want that
  losin' myself in your depth, I wanna be in your last breath
I wanna see the path marked red
I do  care about life, but ther  promise in death
Blacked out in elusive light, I contemplate you hard, yo e always in the dark
So know I know that, but you do  want me
I felt you cold there, I always had love
I ca  let go of that, I was so dumb then
But see, I need to know you want me
Ther  solace in the way you bite my neck
I have  felt this passionate yet
You want me
See, I need to know you want me


Colors (Into Nothing) The love fades against the colo  change
The loss shakes against the cold
Tearing pieces from my decrepit skin
Just to try and keep you warm


Home on Time 

DELETEVERSE

I do  care what we do I just have to know
I do  mean to rush her but I need to go
What does leave me broken, wounded, leaves me low
This is not me reaching
  not overthinking
There was only pieces, I think now   old
First time in a while that  e known control
I ca  keep it simple, I ca  keep it slow
Will you come relieve me?
This is not me leaving
Thought you knew it always
  here if you need me


DELETEVERSE

I can say eye-to-eye
I do  see you enough

You wore the same mascara that you showed me in your room
Hiding under your opaque march moon
I wore the same sunglasses that you showed me in your room
As you pulled them on top of you, I was there

Touching down, but I want to get on top of that


Back to You 


DELETEVERSE

I saw you in the visions there
Saw my ego in the rhythm there, it all comes back to you
In a different meditation kind
I wait til   in heaven and I stare right down to you

And you still know me like that
I know i  like the darkest way to act, tha  how I need you though

Sex Trigger (Burn in Heaven) 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
It takes two of us
One to play the othe  hand
One to crucify the other
New Genesis
Through the light that permeates
Ther  a feeling that I long for
Curious
New ritual
What am I if not eternal?
Can I bite the tongue
That takes from my hand?
Enlightened
Troubled by enlightenment
The two of us both know
That even smarter than the rest
Your heart keeps getting colder
What is sacred, what is best
  speechless


Goodnight 

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Oh, let me hold you closer
Oh, let me hold you closer

Thought I found a light inside of you, no
Learning how these feelings change and they do 
While I walk away
Let me hold you closer

Come in closer
Come in closer
WICCAPHASEVERSE
Like the way I always see your back
I wanna be the one yo e looking at
I  too bad
Time spent together drags
I try to lift us up but falling fast
  taking that
  calling you out from a bad mood
I do  wanna leave but I have to
If I knew yo  pass up my heart, run it through shards
I think that   pass too
And yo e see through
I can see lies but do  see you
See her mind changed and the space grew
Leave a king bed in a shared room
  missing you...


Stockholm Syndrome 
DELETEVERSE

WICCAPHASEVERSE
And   like, "Baby, can I call you baby?"
Every time I need you, yo e too busy ravin'
Even when   next to you, you seem like your states away
Still, I think yo e so cool and I like your attitude
Remember when we first talked? I was out in L.A
Maybe it was Cleveland, I knew how to fade away
In your apartment, I knew how you felt then
All tha  why I came here, but   goin' back to
The same girl that I left with

 in bed, eyes are closed
You say you wanna see me but you do

My baby is a star
And through my new projection, I am resurrected
Then back up to my chest
I watch you from afar
I know my heart is broken, I do  think that you notice

Flashing lights, burning red, ther  a crisis in my head
This is hell to me

Lost Inside the Night WICCAPHASEVERSE
I thought it was out of my hands
Stolen by a feeling I forgot
I felt time together so gone

Same struggles
Tread lightly
Over my shadows

CRYSTALS ARE IN FRAGMENTS 
DELETEVERSE

I was waitin' in the ice so cold when   alone
Misdirection from your body language, you do  want me, no
I like to think of you enough that I start to feel your taste
In a darker kind of rhythm, all I had to do was wait
A colder separation in the path I chose to take
I put that on my life that ther  more to it than this
Like a darker shadow casted when you lean in with your hips
And I say that nothi  right if yo e not opening your arms though
Back to the way that   wishin' that you saw the way   backed Into a corner and you e pressin' on me hard

And you say i  not enough
Unfortunately passionate
You just could  grasp that
You just could  get that
Socia  why I came here
Visions why I  left now

You put me in pain
But i keep callin' out to you
And you just keep on ravin'...

Crystals are in fragments
You put me in pain

Way Down 
WICCAPHASEVERSE
This all becomes a habit, chaos magic
Eating up my heart, tear it out and stab it
Gripping on my arm, go ahead and grab it
(Perfect harmony and charm, yeah I think I have it)
Now I know yo e not that forgiving but I ask for it, yes
I tell you how   feeling when yo e dressed or undressed
If ther  something that you want then yo l get that, bet
This is going back to writing songs for Passionate Yet
New feelings, a new ceiling
You really got my head spinning, my mind reeling

Is that I knew me
Cut through me
And every time you breathe you do it through me
In the back with you show hands
If you want me call my number
If you want me do my dance
I said my numbe  triple seven triple six then
I ca  even remember   too busy stackin bands
Put your arms down in a rigamortis stance then commit to darker passions like I left my band
Strangeways ima come there like i  all part of the plan
The visio  why I came but arrogance is why I left

Goth town girls all know how to act
  so handsome cause I work out to the max
GothBoiClique in the club in the back
Bodies in the basement while   countin' up stacks
Three computers and   on the internet
And   on the internet
Oh, I felt your heart one time
Oh, you still call me your man
Oh, I saw you lookin' so good...


DELETEVERSE

Bloody tears falling down on my sweater
You never wrote back to my love letters
And the rain wo  make me feel better
Now i  winter forever
Ice age in my heart
Life lived in the dark
Out here on my own
Wh  you leave me alone?
If you only knew
How much I need you
Then yo  still be here
But yo e disappeared


DELETEVERSE

Wh  you have to go?
Now   all alone


should have - acoustic WICCAPHASEVERSE
Tie it up, would that be wrong?
Must be the heat that makes my throat hurt in the morning
 e been waking up hot in my own bed
And you always turn your back, but I do  even want to talk about it
Like i  your new way to attack
Show you I have it I pay everything in cash
You tie me up so  l react
 e been calling out to you but   getting no response and   like
If ther  a crisis, i l be the last one
And if I die I hope i  in front of a mirror
 e got a girl but i  super so platonic
 e got a friend but i  really not convincing
It calls me up and I will say that you were not that down
Bodies on the ground, lights really out
Bodies on the ground


Targeted Individual Baby ther  a torment of pain too
You can feel the aura of the hate around it
Black with the back drop of thread
Cursed sage around it
(There was a witch there)
 l never write tonight
Scream to the fire I lie
(?)
Hate to see your eyes through her eyes
Guarded by recorded videos
Tha  what takes your right up to the edge
Then you take a right out to the camp
Cameras saw you bout a mile back
See you through the camera of your phone
Then they overlay your internet
Better keep your eye out for these boys
I  scary how they (?)

The e getting inside of your head
You ca  be sure wh  inside of your house
God what advancements yo e thrown in my way
Malevolence brought me to where I am now

I do  really know what to make of it
How am I to know what to say about it
Misty is the mind with the maze with amazement on it
Suffering from following the paths and the signs
Consequence of living in the margins of time
Tell me what you salvaged between the clothes on the lawn
Why do I check the other (?)

Baby ther  a torment of pain too
You can feel the aura of the hate around it
Black with the back drop of thread
Cursed sage around it
(There was a witch there)
 l never write too much
Scream to the fire I lie

Hate to see your eyes through her eyes


Robin I  the robin that wakes me up in the morning
I  the cat that sits beside me on the bed
  close to pushing far beyond the boundaries
There are nights that I think   already there
If I say I need you then I need you
When I need to get away I get away
Be the passing of the shadow that surrounds me
Be the system that aligns with me again

For when I cause(?) I bend the fog
And ride on forth through first, through falls (?)

Another rush
Another high
Another space
Another time

Now i  time  l explain need you more than ever baby
In a bad (?)
Love in five dimensions
 e been in the pines
In a dream
In your lasting image
I will never pass
Never leave
Forever  l be present
Can you hear me now
Call your name
Tell you   eternal
In the springs of past
Springs of now
Springing forth the knowledge

 l reach out in a massive way
Can you hear me now
Call your name

I  the robin that wakes me up in the morning
I  the cat that sits beside me on the bed
 e never felt so close to a connection
There are nights that I think   already there
If I say I need you then I need you
When I need to get away I get away
The passing of the shadow that surrounds me
Be the system that aligns with me again


MY HEART WO  STFU (KEYBOARD KID REMIX) 
DELETEVERSE

I said I was  goin' away, but then I came here
So clear is the reason that I belong here
I hold back cause everything is in peace now
  at ease when everythin  in i  place here
Instead of bein' a part of the conversation
Who is that makin' sounds at the gate at my house?
When   here and   only here for a weekend
Do you see the dichotomy in my days yet?
You go and do  let me in
Stay awake, so I hear you call, all this is wrapped in guilt
'Cause my eye is a vessel, I keep it open
But what I see got me thinkin' I am a bad man
And if you wait for a second  l be gone
  alone and not alone in my bed
 e got a girl that only pushes away


DELETEVERSE

When you speak everything you say is a secret
And   deprived of sympathy, so I languish
You captivate with your soul and your body language
You move time when you speak in another language
Do what you want,   never here to prevent you
Still I scream and people come to surround you
I train on the heavy bags
And   talkin' to Lil Peep, all this is wrapped in guilt

DELETEVERSE

My heart wo  shut the fuck up from wantin' her so bad
I hold back,   too afraid just to talk to her
I just leave her alone, and stare at my phone


LIKE ICE

Eyes look steady through the rain for you now...
I said, "I  like ice,   givin' to you"


DELETEVERSE

You used to call me back
Now I handle stacks
Find me at my place and w l party
In the palm of my hand
Count it, rubberband
Do you remember when the comin' started?
And its all for you now
Eyes look steady through the rain for you now
I said, "I  like ice,   givin' to you"
I said, "I  like ice, man..."
I said, "I  like ice,   givin' to you"
I said, "I  like ice, man..."
I said, "I  like ice,   givin' to you"
I said, "I  like ice..."


DELETEVERSE

I say move your hand away
Let me call you once, no struggle
I know   conceited
But still   breathin' once,   breathin' on you
Everything became the water, see water
I said, "I  like ice, man..."
Callin' out praise to the witchy daughter, see water
I said, "I  like ice   givin' to you"
I said, "I  like ice, man..."
I said, "I  like ice, man..."


paranoia WICCAPHASEVERSE
Reach out my hands
I am a passing one
(Fantasy Camp)
I learned my lesson
Open my eyes
I can remember once
I saw a strange way
I wanted to understand
I want to feel it within
  looking forward to the mystery and wonder again
And moving forward in time
I ride the tide of intent
And reach out both of my hands
I caught the rest of my life in the most passing of glance
With no distrust in my eyes, I surrender to time
And recognize what I am
I am the sunset shadow son
Casting long across the beach
I put my high beams on, and speed along the coastal highwa  reach
And then I look behind my back
Something dangerous to me

And I keep things (And I keep things)

Drowning in romantic debt (Romantic debt)

In the part of my apartment   like
Keep sweating, keep diving, keep giving
My body, straight swimming
Black water, keep drinking
I was off the taste of like, your tongue
My body, cold stunner

But I was still shaking from your mouth
And I was grabbing at your hair again
I was riding on the belly wave again
So please accept my body
Please relax me steady


DELETEVERSE

We were out there, out there
I wanna see why your body keeps shaking

And in a black stare, black stare
I wanna feel your legs when yo e coming
And   so sure, for sure
So sure,   in it, bae


DELETEVERSE

Everything around is always tying back to me
Elusive in the sauna and   shooting in my sleep
Buying like a sadder kind of feeling running deep
But the baby keeps coming like sh  running over me
I was the silhouette
I know   wild but the passio  getting hotter yet
I  me, your dreamer boy
I am the icy baby
I am the needle baby
I am the sweet retreat, yo e back up on your bleeding
While   grabbing at your hair again
While   riding on the belly wave again
So please accept my body in folds
Please relax me steady, too cold
We were out there, out there
(Out there, out there)
We were out there, out there
I wanna see why your body keeps shaking
I was so cold, on love

MISSING CHILD

Cyber queen the model of the Springs Eternal son
Lucifer my Satan, praise the shadow,   the one
Like super Frieza, custom Eva, touch me on the tongue


DELETEVERSE

So first I calm my ego, man
Then I call, let me see the man
Then I fall back easy, man
I was finishing the pack
A missing child
The hand that corroborates the pain
The icy motion
I breathe in a darker kind of way
  always freezing
Try and put muscle on the weight
Missing child


DELETEVERSE

If   not too cold
If   not too gone
Love me til   dead, it might only be tomorrow
I got you, bae

Yo e pushing me away
  in the rave and the body looks tight
Then   back to where I came
I wanna feel pain in the night
I wanna see your whole body now
I wanna cast a shadow on you now
Theres nobody around I ca  wait to be down
But I ai  too retired for my head
Stupid shit
I was blackin' out in the jet
Now yo e on your knees in the middle of my set
Call me by my name,   the black silhouette
I feel the passion when you shove me in the ground
Bodies on the ground
I hate this feeling now
Bodies on the ground
All of us dead
Elusive in my scent
Icy body wet

She does  believe that i need her though
She does  believe in thelema
Shoutout key nyata and selena
She said sh  put shots in my back
I did  think sh  do me like that

Back up the line
I passed out again
I  hard to believe
That you ca  understand
I want more than love
And she ca  understand
Why i need the attention
From shows and my band

I see audrey in shelly and adam in bobby
I moved from the learjet and into the audi
Yo e marjorie cameron
  aleister crowley
You know i  forever
Tha  adam and audrey

There was a woman in the back of my head
I thought i saw you at the show and i was right
I said that this would be the last one til the next
I could  breathe in with the stabbing in my spine
I thought it so obvious the way it seemed
Ther  no difference between what you did to him and what yo e doing to me
I spent months like trying to get it back
But i can not stand being here alone
I ca  breathe when sh  not answering her phone

Carry my harshest phase, carry another road to break me

Wh  that speaking on a secrret phase?

Find me holding heavy
In the blackest room of data
Tell you to come over

To see what no one sees

Calling all my sinners
Start my three computers
Smoke inside my sauna
See me in your living room
Brushing on your flora
Live for the abduction
My maybach bab  got me
Call my girl Versace
Implant in the neckline
Praise blood, bab  hot
  an agent of the devil
Praise satan and get money


BLINDED // HOLD ME UP 
DELETEVERSE

People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Cause it just makes sense
I pull your hair back for you
And when I stop to relax
I cave in too
I watched you from outside
While I locked myself in
I  easier to want you
When yo e only text and skin

WICCAPHASEVERSE
I do  wanna go
I do  wanna go
Places where
*Lights are blinding my eyes*
Baby, hold me up
*People pushing by*
I ca  see

WICCAPHASEVERSE
Bab  listening to Wiccaphase
Crying with the knife in her hand
  in the corner of your room
Eyes magentagram
The way you tuck your t-shirts in
I wanna be just yours
I wanna feel bones
Give it to me softly
Let them roll up
Let me down gently
WICCAPHASEVERSE
I do  wanna go
I do  wanna go
Places where
*Lights are blinding my eyes*
Baby, hold me up
*People pushing by*
I ca  see
*And walking off into the night*


Filthy I really wanted to break ice with you
Tell me what really matters and how far I can go
  in the sauna, can you get here soon?
I saw your interview
You said you read mine too
There was a presence once
Maybe i  growing

  being filthy but i  not enough
I got your autograph
Like yo e a hologram
 l be your coffin, something to sleep in
 l be your coffin, something to sleep in

I was  nervous when you tapped my mind
I had my arm around you
I talked to you online
There was a presence once
Maybe i  growing

  being filthy but i  not enough
I got your autograph
Like yo e a hologram
 l be your coffin, something to sleep in
 l be your coffin, something to sleep in
 l be your coffin, something to sleep in


Just One Thing (Acoustic) 
DELETEVERSE

Dark resurrection, this is me
Trapped inside my own mouth
Taking care of my house
Have  seen you bare in some time, but tha  on me
In the darkest of ways I go to sleep
Wrapped in a death bag
Alone in a death bed
With no one to talk to
Still trapped in my own head
All I want from her is just one thing


DELETEVERSE

I know, I know the two of us have had a hard time
Speakin' when ther  something to be said
We know, we know the two of us are in a strange way
In a strange place


DELETEVERSE

How do we make our lov grow? I forget
Tell me what you need from m to reconnect


DELETEVERSE

I ca , I ca  read a green light
I  so hard to make out when my head is  on right
I ca  hold you, but I have to
My life in a cube, projections of you
I ca  tell you that i  alright
In blank conversation, depressed on a weeknight
I ca  bring myself around you
In shadows and doom,   thinkin' of you
And how I can connect you back to me
With my hand on her shoulder
How can I get through to her?
I try to bring it up, but I ca  speak

DELETEVERSE

And so   so afraid to love you and my heart hurts always
I want you all the time
Alone, to think that   alone is like my worst fear
I need you right here


DELETEVERSE

How do we make our love grow? I forget
Have  I laid bare my intentions yet?


My Favorite Phase Lips and nails are glowing in the corner of your room
I saw you on the website, but did  know it was you
You say that ther  no consequence
But then you give me pain
And you and my favorite phase

I remember what you said last night
I-I-I remember what you said last night
I remember what you said last night
I-I-I remember what you said last night

Light hits fractured 
DELETEVERSE
 from the corner of your room
I turned on my computer to watch the mirror you
I fill your head with compliments
It only brings me pain
As you and my favorite phase
I watch you wash the light away
Initiate another phase

I remember what you said last night
I remember what you said last night
I remember what you said last night
I remember what you said last night


Black Chardonnay 

sitting at home but trying to find my way home
Absorbing the glass that [?]
Remember the time [?]
I'm staring deep out in Eastern LA
I have a good guess of reaching out to you babe

I'm in the back, I'm watching a screen


One Diamond (Go beyond the common plane)
(Never be our love the same)

Find a fascination and amazed by wha  not there
Magic permeating through the cracks of the known world
Any more than mundane and the plain I will not share
I want to engage
To have and to hold
Celebrating seems that I perceive and you ca  see
Ther  only one diamond that I seek in the whole world
Love in five dimensions you and me
Can you take me away
Now and forevermore?

Watch over me
I saw the hemlock to th East in evergreen
Follow the path back to the shadow that commands
Forbidden fragments of the past I hold in hand
I noticed moments in the past that never leave
I love a song and I remember any line
I run the range without a plan

Asked you to follow me into the dark
Pay no mind or consequence
Not enticed by looking back
Forward as the shoulder bends
Go beyond the common plane
Never be our love the same
Find a fascination and amazed by wha  not there
Magic permeating through the cracks of the known world
Any more than mundane and the plain I will not share
I want to engage
To have and to hold
Celebrating seems that I perceive and you ca  see
Ther  only one diamond that I seek in the whole world
Love in five dimensions you and me
Can you take me away
Now and forevermore?

Asked you to follow me into the dark
Pay no mind or consequence
Not enticed by looking back
Forward as the shoulder bends
Go beyond the common plane

To me i feel so fucking clean
For me she puts the whole thing in
  sad she do  control on me
I  what i want the ice, everything

Just so you know  e been caught in a trap
Just so you know i do  miss anything
She loves me, puts the mark on me
At my last live set she was there on her knees

And you think yo e had enough but you ai  had me yet, and it keeps adding up like you do  want this love…

I write this on my hands but you put me in pain when i can be yr man and pick you up in the benz

Collect this cash in bands like  l pay yr rent…


Symbol Devotion  e been on the inside
Of panic and strife
I do  wanna find myself right back
Change the balance of time
Observing all signs
Ambiguity embraced to the max
With my partner at side
Ambition runs high
Proving loyalty and love in a pact
I will tether and tie
To a moment in time
 l be calling out to make it last

Carry you down a road of black
I can take more than you might think
The symbol of devotion on my hand
Pushing against the violent wind

Hello mystery,  e come to meet the bumps in the road
I put pain inside a prison, it attacks me again
How can I fall asleep at night
Knowing ther  always something else
Shrouding my soul in agony
Finding its way right back to me
(Misery)
 e been on the inside
Of panic and strife
Ther  a portal that I know of in the back
And i  recklessly wrought
Over mountains and heights
And we find that w e got behind the map
When it surfaced, stared their eyes
When the timing is right
In a way what I wanted was to cross that line
Out in the middle that consumes my past
Back to the meadow where the moonlight shines

 e been on the inside
Of panic and strife
I do  wanna find myself right back
Change the balance of time
Observing all signs
Ambiguity embraced to the max
With my partner at side
Ambition runs high
Proving loyalty and love in a pact
I will tether and tie
To a moment in time
 l be calling out to make it last

Carry you down a road of black
I can take more than you might think
The symbol of devotion on my hand
Pushing against the violent wind
(Carry you down a road of black)

(LUST ETERNAL) My lust forever springs eternal
Tha  why your pride i  back in your plan
Because yo e alwaysanswer,so I alwaysstand on
Back on the corner toyour apartment
Desperate gut in your apartment
I want you to stay over again

Did  you lose your shirt in my bed?
You my cristal twin, my ambient dream
What does it take to get your lips on mine?
Heavy breathing down the neckline

You should  care in what I wanted
Grab my ways, put your arms around me
Because yo e always on, yeah, yo e always on
I remember all the pills in your car
Lost in every aspect in your expensive body
I am the death that is come to take you
Please do  let it happen at a party

So catch me at the corner of your heart
Biting in the corner of my mouth
So catch me at the corner of your heart
Biting in the corner of my mouth

I want to be your boyfriend but i  to you to make it happen
My lust forever springs eternal
Have  I been a good slave?


COLD PATH Cold path

DELETEVERSE

Felt you like a biting of the tongue
Cold separation in the setting of the sun
Like lights flash, let the body pass
Move like water then   done
Heartbeat slow I turn me into nothin
I still dream about bodies going numb

When your legs 
DELETEVERSE
 tender
My muscles sore from me ridin'
  holding on my new vices
Becoming the perfect version
Relax my physical fauna
Remember my crystal star of light

Can I have ya? I really want ya

Cold path

DELETEVERSE

Cold path

DELETEVERSE

Brain sits heavy on the spine
Find me drifting like water through time
(I still dream about bodies going numb)
I touched you then
Something hard, it seems
And my heart slow
Purple internet glow
Into the vision sauna
Into my night call
I rode the peace wave home
And I unlocked the door

Can I have ya? I really want ya
Can I have ya? I really want ya

Come and stay here
I mean forever
In the blackout, something colder

Can I have ya? I really want ya


F ME 
DELETEVERSE

I turned your body inward in the hot tub right beside me
I heard you screaming "Adam" through the e-mails and the scenery
In a darker kind of vision 
DELETEVERSE

Like the feeling of the body
The snake and poison biting me
And the lad  on the right of me

DELETEVERSE

She takes the Mercedes, my black and silver baby
The skin melts in paper trails

DELETEVERSE

Passing on and out at once
I ran back to my place

DELETEVERSE
 crystal fauna
Lights on when I want ya
I deny another drink

DELETEVERSE
 chemtrails
All the girls are European
And dancing to The Weeknd
And so are you....


DELETEVERSE

So fuck me like I need to feel your spirit back on top of me
I need ya, I need to taste the solace of your skin again
The iPhone rings, yeah, the iPhone rings
Our insides burn, yeah, the insides burn more

DELETEVERSE

(The iPhone rings, yeah, the iPhone rings)

And you and my favorite phase
